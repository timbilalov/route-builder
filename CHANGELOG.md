* Little UI updates for mobile
* Warning of max points for calc by min distance
* Loading state for map (case with "heavy" calcs)
* Code cleanup
* Simple (and not ideal) cache mechanics for map "heavy" sort calcs.
* Implemented WebWorker, for better UX. Now permutations and other "heavy" calcs can be done in background. Also, some calcs became faster.
* Fixed bad calc for Heap's algorithm. Now it works as expected.
* Correct mechanics and better UI for stages selection
* City selection implemented
* Fixed bug with permutations calc
* Game stages implemented
* Some files converted from .sass to .scss — for better Emmet featuring in WebStorm
* Clean up and audit fix for package.json
* Implemented a new route calculation variant by minimal total distance (finding all possible route permutations based on Heap's algorithm). Also added selector to change calc variant "on a fly".
* Field blocks better look
* Show recognition errors
